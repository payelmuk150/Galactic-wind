# Galactic wind
This repository contains solutions to the hydrodynamical equations of galactic winds including gravitational potential, 
magnetic field structure, cosmic rays and Alfven waves. 

This wind could form a termination shock at distances of O(100 kpc) and could be a site for reacceleration of Galactic 
cosmic rays. We explore this possibility in https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08902.
