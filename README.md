# Galactic wind
This repository contains solutions to the hydrodynamical equations of galactic winds including gravitational potential, 
magnetic field structure, cosmic rays and Alfven waves. 

This wind could form a termination shock at distances of O(100 kpc) and could be a site for reacceleration of Galactic 
cosmic rays. We explore this possibility in https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08902.

The file 'galactic_wind_flow.py' solves the hydro equations of the fluid flow.
The file 'iteration_technique_gwts.py' is the iteration technique developed to solve for the reacceleration of cosmic rays 
at the Galactic wind termination shock detailed in the paper.
